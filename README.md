In my previous project I wasn't aware of the GUI plugins and had to write simpliest user interface by hand, 
so I decided to put them into practise and learn more about these plugins. 

This is my project where I try to create a functional calculator with the help of GUI plugins. I chose calculator specifically because
it has a bunch of buttons that have actual meaning in them (I find it easier when there is purpose behind your actions, what's the point
of creating useless buttons with no meaning to them.)
